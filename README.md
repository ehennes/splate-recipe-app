### Splate

Splate Recipe Search is a web application that helps users discover recipes based on provided search criteria.

### Details

Splate utilizes two endpoints from the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs) to return recipes from a complex search and display detailed recipe information.

User can remove ingredients they already have and bookmark the recipe, which will populate a Grocery List for the user and store the recipe information in localStorage.

#To Do: Add the following:

- Database
- Test Suite
- isLoading feature
- Ability for user to open sidebar to view their Grocery List
- Features for users, including creating their own lists
	- move ‘add ingredient’ option here, persist to database
- Multiple tabs to Lists section so not all lists are displayed at once
- Feature to remove single recipe (currently user can only remove all)
- Planning so users can plan meals for a selected time period
